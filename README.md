# Java Projects 🚀

A collection of simple and advanced Java programs to strengthen problem-solving, logic building, and programming fundamentals.  
This repository reflects my ability to quickly learn, adapt, and implement concepts in real projects.

## ✨ Highlights
- Beginner-friendly programs (e.g., basic arithmetic, conditionals, loops).
- Gradual progression towards advanced topics (OOP, Data Structures, etc.).
- Clean, well-documented, and easy-to-understand code.
- Continuous improvement as I learn and practice.

## 📂 Structure
- Each project/program is organized in separate files for clarity.
- Examples include:
  - Basic Math Operations
  - Conditionals & Loops
  - Object-Oriented Concepts
  - Data Structures (Arrays, LinkedLists, Trees, etc.)
